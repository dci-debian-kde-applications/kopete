kopete (4:4.11.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Team upload.
  * Import part of libjingle's r305 to allow building on unknown architectures;
    patch libjingle_unknown_architecture.diff.
  * Temporarily disable the googletalk integration on non-Linux OSes, as it
    does not build on them and it needs quite some changes to do that.
